- Click "Upload File" button or drag and drop files
- Preview uploaded files (default 10 rows, expandable for more)

### 3. Data Analysis

   - Data types
   - Basic statistical information

2. Enter natural language queries, such as:
   - "Count items by category"
   - "Calculate total sales"
   - "Generate data visualization"

3. Select appropriate model (if multiple models are available)

4. Click "Analyze" to start processing

### 4. View Results

- Results are displayed in a structured format
- Supports text explanations and data visualizations
- Retry functionality available for failed analyses

## Configuration

Key settings in config.py include:
- UPLOAD_FOLDER: File upload directory
- API settings (API_KEY, API_BASE, etc.)
- MAX_RETRIES: Maximum retry attempts

## Important Notes

1. Uploaded files are temporarily stored in the uploads directory
2. Ensure correct API configuration to avoid analysis failures
3. Larger files may require longer processing times
